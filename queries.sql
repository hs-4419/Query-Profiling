-- Prompts used
-- 1) to understand the explain output
-- Execution Plan = Tree Structure
-- ├── Final Step (Top Node) - What you get
-- │ ├── Processing Step (Middle Node)
-- │ │ └── Data Source (Bottom Node) - Where data comes from
-- │ └── Another Processing Step
-- │ └── Another Data Source

-- Step 1: Find the leaf nodes (data sources)
-- Step 2: Follow the flow upward
-- Step 3: Understand what each level does
-- Step 4: See how data flows to final result

-- explain the given query plan for the given query while highlighting these so that it's easy to comprehend

--2) while solving LC and checking the quries I have written
-- While checking the correctness of my query
-- analyze my query in detail in postgres and find all the possible pitfalls and suggest improvements and alternatives/optimizations. Also explain the concepts in detail which are reqd to write the query and their nearby concepts reqd to deepen the knowledge

-- When not able to proceed at all or stuck somewhere
-- i wanna solve this problem
-- make me write the correct query and approach the soln the correct way
-- Also explain the concepts in detail which are reqd to write the query and their nearby concepts reqd to deepen the knowledge
